    "In this lab we will implement one on the seminal <i>anytime</i> heuristic search algorithms -- ARA*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of an anytime algorithm is ''to provide the best possible solution, given a limited computational (time) budget''. In our case, we will start with finding a bounded suboptimal solution with a high suboptimality bound and then will gradually decrease the bound and resume the search. The crux of the algorithm is that it does not re-start the search from scratch but rather re-uses the previuosly built search tree to (significantly) save the search effort. As we will see, a ''smart'' re-use of the search-tree notably outperforms the straightforward approach when one straightforwadly invokes one WA* search after the other from scratch, while decreasing the suboptimality bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the details of ARA* please refer to the <a href=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2003/file/ee8fe9093fbbb687bef15a38facc44d2-Paper.pdf>original paper by Likhachev et al.</a>\n",
